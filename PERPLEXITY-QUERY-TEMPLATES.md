## 📝 QUERY BEST PRACTICES

### **1. Be Specific with Connectors**
✅ Good: "Using my Linear and GitHub:"
❌ Bad: "Check my tasks"

### **2. Use Time Bounds**
✅ Good: "in last 24 hours", "since Jan 1, 2026"
❌ Bad: "recently"

### **3. Request Structured Output**
✅ Good: "Format as checklist with status icons"
❌ Bad: "Give me a summary"

### **4. Combine Multiple Sources**
✅ Good: "Using Linear, GitHub, and Slack:"
❌ Bad: Single source queries (less powerful)

### **5. Include Context**
✅ Good: "For CoreIntent.dev Jan 17 launch"
❌ Bad: Generic queries without project context
